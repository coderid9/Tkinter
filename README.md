# 🐍 Tkinter Mastery: My Python GUI Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Tkinter learning repository! This space documents my journey to mastering Python's built-in GUI toolkit—Tkinter—from scratch. Over the next 15 days, I’ll be building mini-projects, exploring widgets, and experimenting with layouts, styles, and interactivity.

## 📅 Roadmap

- Day 4–6: Input Widgets (Entry, Checkbuttons, Radiobuttons)
- Day 7–9: Layout Managers (Pack, Grid, Place)
- Day 10–12: Advanced Widgets (Canvas, Treeview, Menus)
- Day 13–15: Mini Projects + Packaging

## 🧠 Goals

- Create distributable desktop apps with custom branding

## 🚀 Projects
